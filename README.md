📦 Advanced OOP Inventory Management System (Python)
🎯 Objective
This project is a robust Inventory Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.
It can manage different product types, handle stock operations, process sales, and persist data using JSON files.

This challenge is designed to polish your OOP concepts by applying them in a real-world scenario.


💡 Concepts Demonstrated

✅ Abstraction (abc module).

✅ Inheritance & Polymorphism.

✅ Encapsulation.

✅ Custom exceptions and error handling.

✅ JSON data persistence.

✅ CLI interaction using while loop and user inputs.

📝Notes:-
Data is saved in a JSON file (inventory.json) that you can open and inspect.

If you try to sell more than available stock, or add duplicate IDs, it will raise a custom exception and show the error.

When loading inventory, the system will auto-detect and reconstruct the correct subclass (Electronics, Grocery, Clothing).
